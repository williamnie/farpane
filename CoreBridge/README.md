# RustDesk Native Core Bridge

`include/rustdesk_native.h` is the stable, narrow C ABI consumed by Swift.
`Shim/rdn_shim.c` loads the Rust `cdylib` at runtime and rejects an ABI mismatch.
`RustDeskPatch/` contains the source adapter and patch against the pinned
RustDesk 1.4.9 commit. Generated RustDesk sources and compiled libraries live
under ignored `Vendor/` and `Build/` directories, not in this target.

Only encoded H264/H265 packet bytes cross this boundary. Authentication,
encryption, rendezvous, relay, and the RustDesk wire protocol stay in Rust.
ABI v2 added a single recovery command that asks the existing RustDesk session
to refresh the active display and emit a keyframe after an asynchronous
VideoToolbox decoder failure; it does not expose protocol messages to Swift.
The native client also sends RustDesk's existing non-persistent `custom_fps`
option once per session and the existing delay probe every five seconds. This
restores the capture-pacing and liveness signals normally supplied by
RustDesk's own video thread without exposing either wire message through the C
ABI.

ABI v3 adds pointer and basic keyboard input through semantic C structs. Swift
provides aspect-fit remote coordinates, button/scroll intent, Unicode scalars,
special-key identifiers and modifier flags; it never imports RustDesk protobuf
or internal Rust types. The bridge keeps clipboard/audio disabled, enables
control only for this viewer session, waits for the remote keyboard permission,
clamps coordinates to the current remote display and then reuses RustDesk's
existing `Session::send_mouse` / `Session::input_key` path.

ABI v4 distinguishes precise pixel scrolling from discrete wheel intent and
adds a bounded UTF-8 committed-text call. AppKit owns IME composition and the
candidate UI; Swift forwards only committed text, while Rust reuses
`Session::input_string`. The boundary rejects empty, invalid, NUL-containing or
over-4096-byte input without logging text content.

The opt-in macOS exclusive-keyboard follow-up does not expand the ABI. Swift
captures supported local key events with a session event tap and continues to
send only the same ABI v4 semantic keys. RustDesk Core remains solely
responsible for constructing and transmitting wire-protocol input messages.
